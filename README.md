You must create a website that will mainly provide customer support for the company.
The goal is to make it clear what the company does. Besides the landing page, the
website will need a about page, shop page and a terms of service page. The landing
page should have a About the Team section. There should be a call to action to get
users to call for more information. They would prefer a luxurious design, and would like
you to use the brand color, which is white. Take into account the client's preferences and
values.
